I choose a sequence lenght of 15, which is about 3 times the average line lenght of the script text.  I choose this in the hope that generated text will be based on the memory of not only neihgboring words but of neighboring themes or sentences in the text.  I tried a sequence length of 10 as well but it didnt seem to speed up initial convergence. I'm using a hidden dimension of 250 to learn more features of the scripts but this forced me to increase my number of epochs to get convergence.  I'm using a batch size of 256 to get increased compute performance as well as the cost of possibly getting stuck in some local minima."
